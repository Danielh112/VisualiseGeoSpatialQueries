# VisualiseGeoSpatialQueries
Project designed to allow developers to visualise MongoDB geospatial queries.

1. Connect your MongoDB repository and visualise geospatial data.
2. From here you can generate MongoDB commands including $near, $geoIntersects and $nearSphere

To run application locally

1. Navigate to Project directory using terminal
2. Execute command "node index.js"

Note: It is best to used a MongoDB instance hosted on the same server as the application to eliminate potential latency issues
